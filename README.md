This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

### Migrations and Schema Changes
After changing the schema, run the command below to generate a migration:
```bash
npm run generate
```
What if you have done changes directly on your database? How can I take it and put it here on your code?
Simple, just run the command below:
```bash
npm run pull
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Observations
- I don't know why the scroll bars are appearing even when its not necessary. But I saw that I can use "overflow-auto" instead of "overflow-scroll";

- The dispatch stuff can be called only in sucessfull cases, using like the ".then" or inside a try/catch block that executes the dispatch function only when everything went well.
